# Contributing to IOGT-PWA

Interested in contributing to IOGT-PWA? Thanks! There are plenty of ways you can help.

Thank you for helping us make this project great and being a part of the IOGT-PWA community. Here are a few guidelines that will help you along the way.

## What you need to know

In order to contribute you will need to have a basic understanding of [Polymer](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/), [Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please **ask first** if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for IOGT-PWA. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

## Setting Up a Local Copy

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/unicef/iogt-pwa.git`

2. Run `npm install` in the root `iogt-pwa` folder.

Once it is done, you can modify any file locally and run `npm start`, `npm test` or `npm run build`.

### Coding style

Please follow the coding style of the project. IOGT-PWA uses prettier and eslint, so if possible, enable linting in your editor to get real-time feedback.

- `npm prettier` reformats the code.
- `npm lint` runs manually the linting rules.

Finally, when you submit a Pull Request, they are run again by our continuous integration tools, but hopefully, your code is already clean!
